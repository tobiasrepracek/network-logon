Okay, so to begin installin, create an folder inside your server and unzip "server.zip" file into it.
Then, you need to take that .conf file and upload it to your nginx's sites-enabled folder.
Then change the "directory" inside it to folder that you unzipped "server.zip" into and add www, so less people can access your logs and not everyone (it would be also broken elseway lol).

When you've done this, move to client folder inside this repository.
