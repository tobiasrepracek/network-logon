# network-logon
When a PC starts, it logs it's IP on a server through an PHP api.

Just a little project for my home network so i thought it would be cool to share it here, anyone can take anything from it, i don't have any license for it.

I do not own curl.exe, just took it from my system32, it's present in any Windows 10 Pro build's system32 folder.
