After you successfully set-up an server by files in the "server" folder above, you can just get that "logger.bat" file and copy it into windows's startup directory (access via Win+R and type "shell:startup") and then change it's address that it's using for curl to whatever IP your server runs on.

Yes and it uses curl, which isn't present inside the Windows Home version, so if you use that one, get that curl.exe that i freshly uploaded from my system32 and upload it inside yours system32 on that frickin Windows Home machine. 



(get a Windows Pro for it lol)
